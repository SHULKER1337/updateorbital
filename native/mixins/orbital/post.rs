// A mod's post-processing pass (capability `render`, docs/mods.md): the mod's WGSL fragment shader, after
// `mod_post.wgsl`, drawn over the world's own target (its colour and depth) into a picture of its own, which a
// shader pack's post-processing or the copy onto the screen then takes in place of the world's.
//
// A pass may also be drawn in two stages (docs/mods.md, "A half-size stage"): with an `fs_half` and an `fs_join`
// besides `fs_main`, `fs_half` is drawn into one or two RGBA16F pictures of half the width and height, and `fs_join`
// (which reads them at bindings 6 and 7, declared by the pass itself) over the world in place of `fs_main`. A build
// without the stages, or a pass without them, draws `fs_main` alone: the declarations are only the pass's, so the
// same source compiles and runs on either.
//
// The source is compiled when its version changes; one that does not validate is logged and skipped until the
// mod gives a new one. One the driver fails to build (wgpu's internal and out-of-memory errors: on Metal, its shader
// compiler service dropping the connection on a large pass) is logged and skipped too, and tried again a few
// seconds and then half a minute later, since the next try may work; never a device fault that ends the game.
// `HORIZON_DEBUG_MOD_POST_FAIL=N` makes the first N builds fail that way, to try this on any machine.
//
// The mod's data (`render.set-data`) is a read-only storage buffer, `mod_data`: one word, 0,
// until it gives some, uploaded again only when its version changes.
//
// A mod with capability `atlas` (docs/mods.md, "Block textures in a post pass") is also given the block sprite
// arrays the terrain samples, as they are (animated layers at their current frame, mip levels as the Mipmap Levels
// option leaves them): the first at binding 8, the terrain's sampler at 9 and the other seven arrays at 10 to 16
// (a 1-layer stand-in where the game has fewer). As with bindings 6 and 7 the pass declares them itself, so a pass
// that doesn't sample them compiles and runs everywhere; one that does is refused (logged) by a game without them,
// or for a mod without the capability.

// and depth, a uniform describing the frame, a full-screen triangle, and a few helpers. The renderer's depth is
// reversed (1 at the near plane, 0 at the far plane and for the sky); the helpers turn it back into positions.
//
// A pass may be drawn in two stages: with `@fragment fn fs_half` and `@fragment fn fs_join` besides `fs_main`, the
// game draws fs_half into one or two RGBA16F pictures half the width and height (rounded up; its locations 0 and 1),
// then fs_join over the world in place of fs_main. fs_join reads them as bindings 6 and 7, which the pass declares
// itself, so the same source compiles (and runs fs_main) on a game without the stages:
//     @group(0) @binding(6) var half_picture: texture_2d<f32>;
//     @group(0) @binding(7) var half_extra: texture_2d<f32>;
// fs_half may not read them. `frame.resolution` is the world's picture's in both stages.
//
// A mod with capability `atlas` is also given the game's block textures, the sprite arrays the terrain samples, which
// the pass declares itself too (the same source compiles on a game without them, while it doesn't sample them):
//     @group(0) @binding(8) var block_sprites: texture_2d_array<f32>;
//     @group(0) @binding(9) var block_sampler: sampler;
// and, only for a content mod's textures past the first 2048 layers, arrays 1 to 7 at bindings 10 to 16
// (`block_sprites_1` ...). Each texture is a whole square layer, its UVs 0 to 1; `atlas.block-sprites` says which
// layer a block's faces are and how their UVs run. The sampler is the terrain's (nearest, repeating, nearest mip
// level); the arrays have the mip levels the Mipmap Levels option leaves (textureNumLevels). The texels are as the
// world uses them (gamma-encoded, as scene_color is). Sample with textureSampleLevel or textureSampleGrad (a ray
// marcher's hits are not in uniform control flow). Both stages may sample them.
